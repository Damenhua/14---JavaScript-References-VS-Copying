    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!


    // one way
    let players2 = players.slice()
    players2[0] = "menhua"

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    let players3 = [].concat(players)
    players3[0] = "cowmenhua"
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    let players4 = [...players]
    players4[0] = "Damenhua"
    
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    console.log(players, players2, players3, players4);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    function createName(name) {
      return {
        name // === name:name
      }
    }

    let n1 = createName("menhua");
    let n2 = createName("cowmenhua");
    let n3 = createName("damenhua");

    const all1 = [n1, n2, n3];
    const all2 = all1.slice();

    all2[0].name = "Apple"
    console.log(all1, all2);

    all2[1] = {name: "spice"}
    console.log(all1, all2);



    // with Objects
    let person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    let p2 = person;

    // person = "Damenhua";
    // console.log(person, p2); // === "Damenhua", {}

    person.name = "Apple"
    console.log(person, p2);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    let p4 = Object.assign({}, person);
    p4.age = 40;
    console.log(p4,p2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const wes = {
      name: 'Wes',
      age: 100,
      social: {
        twitter: '@wesbos',
        facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
      }
    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(wes);

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    // dev.social.twitter = null; // wes and dev twitter === null
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    dev2.social.twitter = null; // will not affcet original wes's twitter,not include function
    console.log(wes, dev, dev2);
